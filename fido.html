            <p>Fully integrated dog organizer (FIDO) was my senior project at Portland State University (the volunteers were called DOGS). The project was a scheduling application, run on the browser for the schools volunteer oriented IT organization. Our application was a completely new application from what they were using, and included several features the original did not have, including administrator controls, and importing schedules from a previous term. As the team lead of 6 computer science students, I was tasked with organizing the team's mewetings and project plans, as well as participating in the development.</p>
