            Due to having been unable to attend art school for game design, 
            I found myself declaring a major at Portland State University 
            orientation. Computer science seemed kind of like making games,
            so thats what I put down. After completing my first homework assignment
            and having it actually work (eventually), I experienced what was one of the most 
            rewarding feelings I've felt. Since then I have had a passion for software,
            and a real excitement for creating programs. It wasn't long into my college
            career that I found an even deeper joy out of doing so in a team of like minded 
            individuals, as this gave me an opportunity to use my passion to achieve a goal
            with others.
