            <p>This is an assortment of small programs 
            I've written. They are typically written to 
            explore a concept or technology, and please
            feel free to download them and play around with
            them!</p>

            <h1>PyWeather</h1>
            <br>
            <p>This program allows a user to input a city, and state (if in US) or country (outside the US). I used PyWeather as an opportunity to learn about REST APIs a little better, as well as the basics of making a UI.</p>

            <h1>WikiBlurb</h1>
            <br>
            <p>On the same vein as PyWeather, WikiBlurb is a simple python program with a UI made using TKinter, that makes a REST API call to retrieve data. This app allows a user to enter a query, which could be any subject of interest, and it will present the introduction paragraph of the wikipedia page for that subject. </p>
